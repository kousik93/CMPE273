This is a client side consistant hashing program. Consistant hasing is used for sharding database.

I have used murmur for the hash function.

server.go - Server file to store and retreive data.
client.go - Client file that performs all the work

Running Server:

go run server.go 4000-4015

Running Client:

go run client.go 4000-4015 "1->A,2->B,3->C,4->D,5->E,6->F,7->G,8->H"
