File List:
	* app.go - The main app code
	* input.bson - The input file for the program. Must be provided beforehand
	* output.bson - Will be generated at runtime. Will be overwritten for each retry/request
	* screenshots/ - The folder which holds screenshots showing the running of the application

TO RUN:
	* go run app.go input.bson

Note 1: 
	* input.bson should only have 1 object. ie, it should be { ... }. 
	* Code does not support [{ ... } , { ... }]
	* The example input.json provided by the professor was of this format only.

Note 2: 
	* 'bson' and the respective import was actually never used in the code as it was unnecessary.
	* The function prototypes provided by the professor in the Baseline code have been modified.

Note 3:
	* I have not been able to test for a scenario where request succeeds after failing a few times (It happens really fast). But the implimention exists.

URL to test Status codes:
	* http://httpstat.us/504
	* http://httpstat.us/200
	* http://httpstat.us/404

Flow:
	* Take request from input.bson (Only 1 request as per format provided by professor in github)
	* Dpending upon response decide to stop or retry.
	* Retry for the allowed number of times.
	* If max retry reached, FAILED

Output file: 
	* output.bson
